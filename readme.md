	<h1>Thread Media Viewer</h1>
</div>

Userscript that adds comfy media browser and viewer to various discussion boards.

Replaces any built in media viewer (the way images/videos show up when you click on them), and adds a concise and easily navigable media list box with all media files in a thread.

Toggle the list by pressing `` ` `` (backtick, right below Escape button). Settings and help are right there at the bottom of it.
